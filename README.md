# What the project is about
Zombs.io Server Scanner is a project that automates the process of entering a server in the game Zombs.io and retrieving the leaderboard information. This tool is useful for players and developers who want to analyze player statistics, and leaderboard standings over time.

# Why the project was started

Creating a project called Server Scanner is a response to a project of similar nature created by an individual known as "serplent." This undertaking serves as a way to showcase superior coding capabilities and attention to detail. By developing a reliable, efficient, and well-structured server scanner, the aim is to demonstrate the contrast in quality between the two projects and prove that serplent lacks the technical proficiency to deliver a polished and effective tool. This retaliation through a competing project not only highlights the technical deficiencies of serplent's project but also emphasizes the importance of clean, maintainable code and proper project management in software development.
